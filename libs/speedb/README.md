# Speedb
[Website](https://www.speedb.io) ‚Ä¢ [Docs](https://docs.speedb.io/) ‚Ä¢ [Community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5fVUUtM2cG) ‚Ä¢ [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM987hjxRxI&list=UULF6cdtbCAzRnWtluhMsmjGKw&index=2)

A first-of-its-kind, community-led key-value storage engine, designed to support modern data sets. 

Speedb is a 100% RocksDB compatible, drop-in library, focused on high performance, optimized for modern storage hardware and scale, on-premise and in the cloud. 
We strive to simplify the usability of complex data engines as well as stabilize and improve performance for any use case.

We are building an open source community where RocksDB and Speedb users and developers can interact, improve, share knowledge, and learn best practices. You are welcome to join our community, contribute, and participate in the development of the next generation storage engine. We welcome any questions or comments you may have. Please use issues to submit them, and pull requests to make contributions.


**Join us to build the next generation key-value storage engine!**

## üìä Example Benchmark

Below is a graph comparing Speedb and RocksDB running a massive random write workload.

The test was running on a database with 80 million objects, while the value size is 1KB and 50 threads. 

The graph below shows how Speedb can handle massive write workloads while maintaining consistent performance over time and without stalling, thanks to its improved delayed write mechanism.

![random-writes-delayed-writes](https://github.com/speedb-io/speedb/assets/107058910/dca2785a-d43f-494d-ad34-815ade50ca7a)


You can read more about the new delayed write mechanism and other features and enhancements in the Speedb [documentation](https://docs.speedb.io/enhancements/dynamic-delayed-writes).

## üí¨ Why use Speedb?
* Improved read and write performance with Speedb by enabling features like the new [sorted hash memtable](https://docs.speedb.io/speedb-features/sorted-hash-memtable) 
* Stabilized performance with the improved [delayed write mechanism](https://docs.speedb.io/enhancements/dynamic-delayed-writes) 
* Reduced memory consumption when using features like the [Speedb paired bloom filter](https://docs.speedb.io/speedb-features/paired-bloom-filter)
* Easy to maintain - with Speedb you can [change mutable options](https://docs.speedb.io/speedb-features/live-configuration-changes) during runtime 
* Easy to manage multiple databases

And many more!

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

The [product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/speedb-io/projects/4/views/1) provides a snapshot of the features we are currently developing, what we are planning for the future, and the items that have already been delivered.

We have added a column with items that are awaiting community feedback. We invite you to participate in our polls inside, share your thoughts about topics that are important to you, and let us know if there is anything else you would like to see on the list.


## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage
* If speedb is in your default library path:


  In your `CMakeLists.txt` add:
  ```
  target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} speedb)
  ```
  where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of your target application which uses speedb

* Otherwise, you have to include the path to the folder the library is in like so:
	
  ```
  target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} /path/to/speedb/library/folder)
  ```


Usage of the library in your code is the same regardless of whether you statically linked the library or dynamically linked it, and examples can be found under the [examples](examples) directory.
The public interface is in [include](include/rocksdb). Callers should not include or rely on the details of any other header files in this package. Those internal APIs may be changed without warning.


## ‚õìÔ∏è Build dependencies

Please refer to the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for a list of all the
dependencies and how to install them across different platforms.


## üî® Building Speedb 

Debug:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug [cmake options]
    make speedb

By default the build type is Debug.

Release:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [cmake options]
    make speedb

This will build the static library. If you want to build the dynamic library,
use:

    make speedb-shared

If you want `make` to increase the number of cores used for building, simply use
the `-j` option.

If you want to build a specific target:

    make [target name]

For development and functional testing, go with the debug version which includes
more assertions and debug prints. Otherwise, for production or performance
testing, we recommend building a release version which is more optimized.

## üìà Performance 

We are using DBbench to test performance and progress between the versions. It is available under tools and also in the artifact for direct download.
In there you can also find a readme with the commands we are using to get you started. 





## üìö Documentation

You can find a detailed description of all Speedb features [here](https://speedb.gitbook.io/documentation/).

[Speedb's documentation repository](https://github.com/speedb-io/documentation) allows you to enhance, add content and fix issues.
